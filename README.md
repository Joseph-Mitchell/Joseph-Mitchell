  My name is Joseph Mitchell, and I am a graduate of Edinburgh Napier University with a First Class Honours in BSc Games Development. Throughout my education I have had experience not only with the more creative side of Game Dev, but also in many technical aspects of         Software Engineering as a whole. <br>
  I still enjoy learning new things within and without the world of software engineering, and am often thinking of new creative projects to spend my time on.

  Right now I'm attending the Digital Futures academy on the Software Engineering course in order to fill out spaces in my experience.
